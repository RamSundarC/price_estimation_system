Price_Predicter:


Description:

This code predicts the price of precious metals (gold, platinum, and silver) using linear regression.
The data for the years 2000-2023 is provided in the data.xlsx file.

Usage
To use the code, first run the import statements at the top of the file. Then, enter the name of the
precious metal you want to predict the price of in the ip=input() statement. The code will then print
a dataframe or line chart of the price data for the metal, and it will also predict the price of the
metal in the year you specify.

Example
To predict the price of gold in the year 2024, you would enter the following code:
python
ip = "Gold"
Print the dataframe or line chart of the price data for gold.
sorter(ip)
Predict the price of gold in the year 2024.
regression(x, y)
Plot the actual data and the predicted data.
plotter()


Output
The output of the code will vary depending on the precious metal you specify and the year you
predict the price for. However, the output will always include a dataframe or line chart of the price
data for the metal, as well as the predicted price of the metal.
